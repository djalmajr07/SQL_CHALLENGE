This repository contains the solutions for the case studies in **[8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**.
The 8 Week SQL Challenge is started by Danny Ma through Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program, which consists of 8 different SQL challenges.

Each case-study folder contains the following files
- A readme file explaining the problem statement and datasets used
